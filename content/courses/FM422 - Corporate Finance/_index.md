## Course Information


This core course provides a broad introduction to the key issues in corporate finance. 

The first half of the course, the **Financing Module**, investigates how companies should finance their activities by issuing securities (debt, equity and convertible claims) and the interaction of business policy with financial policy. The aim is to understand what factors determine optimal capital structure and how the interplay of these factors can affect financing decisions in a way that creates value. 

The second half of the course, the **Valuation Module**, covers firm and project valuation and establishes how companies should select among investable assets. The module focuses on fundamental valuation techniques based on discounting future cash flows. The course goes on to introduce further valuations methods, such as real options analysis, as well as key applications of valuation concepts to major corporate decisions such as mergers and acquisitions and initial public offerings. The course interweaves key conceptual material with a series of cases.
